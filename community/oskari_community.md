## Community behind the software

We are the Oskari Community: growing group of organizations, individuals and developers putting their interests together to improve and develop Oskari software.

Oskari development started already in 2008 when the first plans for Finnish national geoportal were drafted by the National Land Survey of Finland. 

In 2011 Oskari's source code was opened because the interest within other organisation for similar map services became evident. After this the utilization of Oskari has grown from public sector using Oskari in multiple ways to companies providing Oskari based services. 

The start of the actual Oskari community was in 2014 when a network for Oskari users was established in Finland and the Joint Development Forum was founded. Now we have tens of organisations involved in Finland and abroad! 

Development is not just coding, it can be bug reporting, finding funding or marketing. Read  the [community goals and tasks](community_goals.md) and join the development!

If you can't find resources for developing, you can always try to set up a crowd funding plan. We help you to market it through our Oskari newsletter and other media.

### Individuals

Anyone is free to use Oskari source code and make it even better! If you have an idea, please join Oskari discussion in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/oskariorg/chat). 

### PSC and OSGeo

In late 2016 [Oskari PSC](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-docs/wiki/Project-Steering-Committee) was established. Oskari's PSC (Project Streeting Committee) is responsible for checking the code and they decide which features are added to the Oskari core.

### Joint Development Forum

Joint Development Forum is a tight group of organisations that have an interest in developing Oskari togerther. It is formed by several organisational members providing funding for joint development, communication and bug fixing. Read more about the [JDF](JDF.md).

### Community members

It is totally free to be part of the Community. Organisational members have the opportunity to apply for the JDF as annual representatives of the community members. The new community members are elected every spring. Tell us how you are going to take advantage of Oskari, it can be software development, arranging meetups, education - all activities are encouraged. If you want to join the Oskari network as a organizational member, describe your [organisation and development ideas on Oskari here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2KZOQeJ5xDivG-X0r0HzMArHcRU6DRbb1hpS1uUS87VrY3w/viewform).
